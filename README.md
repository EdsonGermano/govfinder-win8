# GovFinder by Socrata for Windows 8

![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

GovFinder by Socrata uses city-provided open data to allow citizens to find, and comment on, important data and services provided by their city. GovFinder currently supports Chicago, Edmonton, and New York City. More cities are on the way soon. A Socrata or Windows Live ID is required for report contracts. As city data is sometimes inconsistent data that is not present is represented by default values such as 'na' for text files like titles or default images where feeds are not providing valid images so we can still see the location even when the source data coming into the system is incomplete.
